        // In an array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates, how do you find it? (solution)
        // One trick in this programming questions is by using HashMap or Hashtable, we can store a number as key
        // and its occurrence as value if the number is already present in Hashtable then increment its value or
        // insert value as 1 and later on print all those numbers whose values are more than one.

        // Given two arrays, 1,2,3,4,5 and 2,3,1,0,5 find which number is not present in the second array.
        // Here is a quick tip to solve this programming question: put the elements of the second array in the
        // Hashtable and for every element of the first array, check whether itâ€™s present in the hash or not, O/P
        // all those elements from the first array that are not present in the hash table

        // How do you find the second highest number in an integer array?

        // How to find all pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to the given number? (solution)

        // How to find the largest and smallest number in an array? (solution)

        // How to find the top two maximum number in an array? (solution)
