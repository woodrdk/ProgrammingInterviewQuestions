// In an array 1-100 exactly one number is duplicate how do you find it?
// In an array 1-100 multiple numbers are duplicates, how do you find it?
//        One trick in this programming questions is by using HashMap or Hashtable, we can store a
//        number as key and its occurrence as value if the number is already present in Hashtable then
//        increment its value or insert value as 1 and later on print all those numbers whose values are
//        more than one.


// Given two arrays, 1,2,3,4,5 and 2,3,1,0,5 find which number is not present in the second array.
// Here is a quick tip to solve this programming question: put the elements of the second array in
// the Hashtable and for every element of the first array, check whether itâ€™s present in the hash or not,
// O/P all those elements from the first array that are not present in the hash table

// How to find all pairs in an array of integers whose sum is equal to the given number?
// How to remove duplicate elements from the array in Java?
