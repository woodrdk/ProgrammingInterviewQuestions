// Write code to check whether a no is a power of two or not?
// Write a program to check whether a number is a palindrome or not?
// Check out this post which shows how to reverse a number in Java and can be used to find if its palindrome
// or not.

// Write code to check whether an integer is Armstrong number or not?
// Here is a Java program to find Armstrong number, you can use the same logic to write code in any other
// programming language like C and C++.

// Write a program to find all prime number up to a given number?
// Here is another Java program to find prime numbers and print them.
// By using logic demonstrated in this program; you can write a similar program in C and C++.

// Write a function to compute Nth Fibonacci number? Both iterative and recursive?
// You can check this Java program to print Fibonacci Series using recursion and iteration.

// How to check if a number is binary?
//  For this question, you need to write a function which will accept an integer and return true if it
//  contains only 0 and 1 e.g. if the input is 123 then your function will return false,
//  for 101 it should return true.

// How to reverse an integer in Java?
// How to count a number of set bits in given integer?
// How to find the sum of digits of a number using recursion?
// How to swap two numbers without using temp variable?
// How to find the largest of three integers in Java?
// Write a program to find prime factors of an integer?
// How to add two integers without using arithmetic operator?
